Monte Carlo Simulation to plot fatal outcomes over time on fumble and crit
homebrew rules in DnD

Author: Geoff Moore

Monte Carlo Simulation of fatal outcomes on DnD dice rolls. My current game
involves homebrew rules with some fatal or character retiring outcomes
for fumbles and crits. This program simulates this scenario and plots the
cumulative occurrence of fatal outcomes over time. It also calculates
probabilities of fatal outcomes from the generated data which can be used
to check the model against actual probabilities. Values for cutoffs for
crits and fumbles on the d20 and fatal outcomes on the d100 can be varied.
