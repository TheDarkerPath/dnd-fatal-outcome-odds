Calculates odds for fatal outcome on fumbles and crits in DnD homebrew

Monte Carlo Simulation of fatal outcomes on DnD dice rolls.
My current game involves homebrew rules with some fatal or character retiring
outcomes for fumbles and crits. This program simulates this scenario to study
the probabilities of fatal outcomes and plots the occurence
of fatal outcomes over time.
